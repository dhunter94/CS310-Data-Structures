"For this assignment, you will write four implementations of a Priority Queue. For this ADT, removal operations always return the object in the queue of highest priority that has been in the queue the longest. That is, no object of a given priority is ever removed as long as the queue contains one or more object of a higher priority. Within a given priority FIFO order must be preserved. Your four implementations will be:

Ordered Array
Unordered Array
Ordered Linked List
Unordered Linked List
All four implementations must have identical behavior, and must implement the PriorityQueue interface (provided). The array-based implementations must have two constructors, a default constructor with no arguments that uses the DEFAULT_MAX_CAPACITY constant from the PriorityQueue interface, and a constructor that takes a single integer parameter that represents the maximum capacity of the PQ."
