For this assignment, you will write the ArrayLinearList class, an array based implementation of the LinearListADT interface (given below). A 'list' is a sequence of values. The ordering of the items in the list is not specified but does matter, and is in fact problem dependent. No insertion ever occurs at an arbitrary location. When an item is removed from the list, the ordering of the remaining elements in the list is unchanged.

Your implementation will be array-based. But the Linear List is unbounded. An insertion should never fail as long a memory remains available in the computer.
