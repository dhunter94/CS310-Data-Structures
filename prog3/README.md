"This program is an example of an application that uses a very common interface, the DictionaryADT. A dictionary is a structure that accepts key=value pairs. The keys are used to order the structure and to lookup values.  Keys must be distinct; no duplicates are allowed.   There may, however, be duplicate values. For this dictionary application, the key is a latin word, and the value is its definition. "

"The DictionaryADT must be implemented in four ways:
* Binary Search Tree
* HashTable with chaining
* Ordered Array
* Red/Black Tree "
